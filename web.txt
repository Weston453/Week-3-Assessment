**How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? **

The internet is a connection of many computers. Computers comunicate with one another to send and recieve data. Using IP addresses allow computers
to accurate send data to the correct location. Routers are also nessisary to help connect computers together. Routers help route requests to the 
correct location and by adding a router to the system we can reach more and more locations accross the globe, scaling up our internet. these routers 
also connect to internet service providers through their routers that can comunicate with routers from other internet service providers. 
This increase our connections of computers.

when you click on a link your browser makes a get request to the IP address assigned to that server. Then, the App code finishes exectution.
In return, the server processes the request and responds with the appropriate end point. The browser then recieves html, css, and json code 
and starts to interpret the code to display the requested end point. When the browser finishes intrepreting the recieved code, it displays the
page for the user.
